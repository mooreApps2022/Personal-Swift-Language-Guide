// The ContentView struct is conforming to a View protocol. Views are very important to SwiftUI. 
// The View protocol means the struct has to have a body property. (A property is a variable declared inside the struct.)
// The body has belong to the some View protocol. 
// Whatever is inside the body brackets is what the user is going to see, when the ContentView is called. 
// Text() is the most basic view there is. Whatever string you put in there will be displayed on the screen. In this case Hello World would be displayed.
