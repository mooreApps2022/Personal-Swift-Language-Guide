# Personal-Swift-Language-Guide
This repo is meant to be a collection of all the things I've learned about the Swift language, using the SwiftUI framework.

A little about myself, I'm currently a bartender in Los Angeles and I've been one for about 5 years. Before that I was an actor for 10 years. During the covid lockdown, I was on unemployement because all the restuarants closed down. I used the extra time to learn Swift. As of today, I put my first app on the Apple App Store. It's called Tip Out, it does the tip out report for bartenders and waiters at the end of their shift. 


I used too many resources to list, but the best resources I recommend, are the free Swift Playgound on the App Store, Matt Neuberg's iOS 15 Programming Fundamentals with Swift: Swift, Xcode, and Cocoa Basics(the language part is guest, but he only explores UIKit in the later parts), Angela Yu's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp, Nick Sarno's free Swiftful Thinking channel on Youtube, SwiftUI Masterclass 2022 - iOS App Development & Swift on Udemy, and Paul Hudson's Hacking With Swift. All these have been the most meaningful Swift resource online. 

I also recommend the books Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold and The Universal Computer by Martin Davis. Code will teach you how computers work and The Universal Computer will give you an overview of how formal logic turned into programming languages and about all the incredible people who made it happen. 

I'm currently working on my next app and I wanted to built this repo to sum up all the things I'm learn. It's basically my own personal language guide written in a accessible way, to not only further my own understand, but maybe help out anyone else learning Swift. 

My goal is to just upload a few files a day, each one explaining one simple idea about Swift, SwiftUI, Design patterns, and actually employ classic data structures and algorithms in SwiftUI or anything else I find interesting.
